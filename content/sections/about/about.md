I'm a Computer Engineering student born in Costa Rica. Currently trying to learn as much as I can about new technologies and better ways to build things with software.

I love facing new challenges that require me to expand my knowledge on a topic I knew very little about. Also, I'm constantly trying to find ways to do things faster and more efficiently so I can spend more time doing other things I love, like cooking! ðŸŒ®
